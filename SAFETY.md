# Safety and Legal Notice

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

This project is designed **EXCLUSIVELY** for educational and testing purposes. It demonstrates distributed browser automation patterns similar to those used in legitimate testing frameworks like Selenium Grid or Playwright Docker deployments.

## What This Project Does

- **Mock Testing Environment**: All interactions target a local mock crash game site
- **No Real Gambling**: No actual money, cryptocurrency, or real gambling occurs
- **Educational Purpose**: Demonstrates distributed system architecture patterns
- **Safe Testing**: Uses only local Docker containers and mock data

## What This Project Does NOT Do

- ❌ **No Real Gambling**: Does not interact with real gambling sites
- ❌ **No Real Money**: No actual financial transactions
- ❌ **No External Accounts**: No real user accounts or credentials
- ❌ **No Real Cryptocurrency**: No actual crypto transactions
- ❌ **No Real Site Automation**: Does not target real websites

## Safety Measures Implemented

### 1. Mock Target Only
- All browser automation targets `http://localhost:3001` (mock crash site)
- No external URLs or real gambling sites are accessed
- Mock site simulates game mechanics without real money

### 2. Local Environment
- All components run in Docker containers on localhost
- No external API calls to real gambling services
- No real user authentication or account creation

### 3. Educational Focus
- Demonstrates legitimate testing patterns
- Shows distributed system architecture
- Teaches browser automation concepts safely

### 4. Code Safeguards
- Hardcoded local URLs prevent external access
- No real API keys or credentials
- Clear warnings in UI about demo-only nature

## Legal Compliance

This project is designed to be:
- **Educational**: Teaches distributed system patterns
- **Safe**: No real gambling or financial risk
- **Legal**: No illegal activities or real site automation
- **Transparent**: Clear documentation of demo-only nature

## Responsible Use

### For Developers
- Use only for learning distributed system patterns
- Do not modify to target real gambling sites
- Understand this is a demonstration, not a production system
- Follow local laws and regulations

### For Educators
- Use to teach browser automation concepts
- Demonstrate distributed system architecture
- Show containerization and orchestration patterns
- Emphasize the educational nature

## Technical Architecture

This project demonstrates:
- **Microservices**: Separate dashboard, controller, and worker services
- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local management
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for live updates
- **Telemetry**: Data collection and monitoring
- **Scalability**: Multiple worker instances

## Reporting Issues

If you find any safety concerns or potential issues:
1. Do not use the system for real gambling
2. Report issues through proper channels
3. Ensure all testing remains local and safe
